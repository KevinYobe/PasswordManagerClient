# PasswordManagerClient
A UI application for Password Manager service. This is a web project, written with Spring and Thymeleaf. It allows a user to: 
1. Create an account
2. Add a password 
3. Modify an existing password
4. Delete a password. 

This can be for either corporate or individual use. Corporates have an admin that os responsible for adding, updating and removing users. 
This is to be used simultaneously with passwordmanager server. Password manager server stores and processes security for stored passwords. 

UI is still work in progress. Will deploy version 1.0 once the UI has improved. 
Allows provision for Admin users and Super Admin. Admin users are able to: 
1. View users
2. Modify users. 

Super Admin users are able to delete users and promote a user to be an Admin/Super Admin
